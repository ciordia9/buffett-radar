The January 6 filing (8-K/A) is significant as it formally documents the CEO transition to Greg Abel. No other material events have been filed in the past 7 days, which is normal for this time period. The next major filing event will be the Q4 2025 13F on February 14, which will reveal any portfolio changes made in Q4 2025 (Buffett's final quarter as CEO).
