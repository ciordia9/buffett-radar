# Notes for Week 2025-W53 Radar Execution

## New This Week: Competing Narratives Framework

Starting with W52, we're tracking two competing theses about Berkshire's 2026 positioning:

### File: `competing_narratives_2026.json`

**Purpose:** Organic accumulation of evidence for/against each thesis. No rigid scoring system—just pattern recognition.

**How to Use During Weekly Radar:**

1. **Read the file first** before starting analysis (Phase 1 or 2)
2. **As you gather data**, note any evidence that supports or challenges either thesis
3. **Add to evidence_log** under appropriate thesis with week tag and "supporting" or "challenging" label
4. **Update weekly_evaluation** section with new week's assessment
5. **Don't force conclusions**—let inflection points emerge naturally

### The Two Theses:

**Bear Case (Fiorillo):** Tech underexposure = continued underperformance in tech-led 2026  
**Bull Case (Socci):** Operating businesses (BNSF, BHE, Manufacturing) = perfect XLI/XLU sector rotation play

### Key Data Points to Watch Each Week:

**Stock Performance:**
- BRK.B vs SPY gap (widening = bear case, narrowing = bull case)
- XLI and XLU vs SPY performance (outperforming = bull case)
- RSP vs SPY (equal-weight outperforming = bull case)

**Operating Business Signals:**
- BNSF: Volume trends, pricing power, freight mix (especially industrial products)
- BHE: Utility margins, retail volumes, capex deployment
- Manufacturing: Industrial products segment (volumes, margins, earnings)

**Portfolio Moves (when 13F data available):**
- Apple position changes (continued trimming = bear case validation)
- New tech positions (= bear case influencing Abel)
- New industrial/utility positions (= bull case validation)
- Cash position trajectory

**Greg Abel Actions (starting Jan 1, 2026):**
- Any strategic announcements
- First shareholder letter (Feb 2026)
- Capital deployment decisions
- Operational changes to business units

### Important Inflection Points Coming:

1. **Jan 1, 2026:** CEO transition (W53 will capture this)
2. **Feb 14, 2026:** Q4 2025 13F filing due
3. **Late Feb 2026:** Q4 2025 10-K and annual shareholder letter
4. **Q1 2026:** First full quarter under Abel, sector performance trends

### Principle:

We're not trying to **predict** which thesis wins. We're trying to **recognize** when the market signals which thesis **is winning**.

The evidence will tell us when to migrate from one view to another. Until then, we accumulate data points.

## W52 Summary (for context):

- BRK.B: -2.34% weekly, -8.15pp vs SPY YTD (gap widening)
- Stock performance supports bear case
- Q3 operating fundamentals support bull case (BNSF +10% earnings, BHE +9.9% margins, Manufacturing +24.3% industrial earnings)
- Market appears to be pricing equity portfolio (tech-light) rather than operating businesses (XLI/XLU exposure)
- Too early to call which thesis is winning

## Reminder for AI Agent:

When you run next week's radar:
1. Read `competing_narratives_2026.json` during Phase 2 or 3
2. As you gather news/data, mentally tag evidence as supporting/challenging each thesis
3. Update the evidence_log and weekly_evaluation sections
4. Note any inflection points or pattern changes
5. Keep the analysis organic—don't force it into a narrative

The goal is to be **early** in recognizing when one thesis starts winning, so we can adjust positioning before it's obvious to everyone.
