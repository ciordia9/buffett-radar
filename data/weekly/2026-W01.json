    "strategic_interpretation": "Berkshire's market posture remains highly defensive despite the leadership change. The record cash position ($372B after OxyChem), absence of buybacks for 19 months, and sustained net selling of equities all point to maximum caution regarding current market valuations. The OxyChem deal demonstrates Abel's willingness to deploy capital, but into wholly-owned businesses rather than overvalued public equities. The energy sector strength (OXY, CVX) validates Berkshire's significant exposure, while weakness in financials (MCO, AXP) may signal concerns about credit conditions or economic headwinds ahead.",
