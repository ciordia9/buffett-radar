        "summary": "SEC filing reveals Berkshire may sell 'up to' almost all of its 27.5% Kraft Heinz stake ($7.5B). Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren views this as Abel's desire to 'clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure.' Represents willingness to exit Buffett-era mistakes (paid $9.8B, now worth $7.5B, total loss $2.3B) rather than hold indefinitely. Buffett admitted in 2019: 'We overpaid for Kraft.'",
        "sentiment": "neutral/proactive",
        "key_insight": "Abel's first major portfolio move demonstrates decisiveness and willingness to admit mistakes. Pattern emerging: clean up legacy positions (Kraft Heinz) while deploying into wholly-owned industrial/utility assets (OxyChem $9.7B, BHE transmission $1.2B). This is portfolio management, not passive holding."

        "summary": "Despite Socci's W52 thesis that BRK is positioned for XLI/XLU sector rotation, five weeks into 2026 the data shows rotation is NOT happening. Financials persistently weak (BAC -2.36% W05, -4.02% W04; MCO -2.76% W05), energy mixed (OXY +3.28%, CVX +0.28%), tech lagging but not collapsing (AAPL -2.93%, GOOGL -0.63%). Only consumer staples (KO +3.46%) showing strength - defensive positioning, not rotation.",
