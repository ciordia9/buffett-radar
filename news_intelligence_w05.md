## Major News Event: Kraft Heinz Exit Signal

### Story: Greg Abel's First Portfolio Cleanup Move

**Source:** CNBC (Alex Crippen), January 24, 2026

**Key Development:** Just three weeks into his tenure as CEO, Greg Abel has signaled Berkshire may exit its troubled Kraft Heinz (KHC) stake. An SEC filing on Tuesday January 20 revealed Berkshire may sell "up to" almost all of its 27.5% stake, currently worth $7.5 billion.

**Historical Context:**
- Berkshire joined with 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz for $23.3B in 2013
- Kraft merged with Heinz in 2015 (deal championed by Buffett)
- Peak value: ~$30B in 2016
- Current value: $7.5B (down 75% from peak)
- **Total loss:** ~$2.3B (paid $9.8B, now worth $7.5B)
- Buffett admitted in 2019: "We overpaid for Kraft"

**Market Reaction:**
- KHC fell 7% immediately after filing, to $21.99 (near 6-year low)
- Ended week at $23.20 (-1.4% for the week)

**Analyst Interpretation:**
- **Morningstar's Greggory Warren:** "We view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure."
- Represents Abel's willingness to exit Buffett-era mistakes rather than hold indefinitely
- Signals proactive portfolio management approach

**Implications:**
1. **Capital deployment pattern emerging:** Abel is cleaning up legacy positions (Kraft Heinz) while deploying into wholly-owned industrial/utility assets (OxyChem $9.7B, BHE transmission $1.2B)
2. **Cash position pressure:** Exiting KHC adds $7.5B to already massive cash pile (~$372B after OxyChem), increasing pressure to deploy
3. **Philosophical shift:** Abel appears more willing than Buffett to admit mistakes and move on quickly

## Other Significant News

### 1. Berkshire Underperformance Narrative Intensifying

**Sources:** Multiple (Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, Morningstar)

The narrative around Berkshire's underperformance is gaining traction:
- **2025 full year:** BRK.B underperformed S&P 500 by -8.15pp
- **2026 YTD (through W05):** Underperformance gap has widened to -4.49pp
- Some analysts frame this as "end of an era" under new leadership
- Others argue market is mispricing BRK by focusing on equity portfolio rather than operating businesses

### 2. Operating Business Updates

**BNSF Railway (Business Wire, January 13, 2026):**
- Reported safest year ever in 177-year history
- Employee injury frequency down 10%
- Rail equipment incidents down 13%
- Demonstrates operational excellence, but no revenue/volume data disclosed
- Q4 financial data due late February with 10-K

**Winter Storm Impact:**
- Reuters reported BNSF warned winter storm would snarl rail traffic across central US corridors
- Temporary operational disruption, not structural concern

### 3. Market Valuation Concerns

Several articles highlighted extreme market valuations:
- S&P 500 near record highs (6,986.33 was 52-week high)
- Forward P/E ratio: 22.1 (above 5-year average of 20.0)
- Gold surged past $5,000/oz for first time (flight to safety signal?)
- Some analysts warning of "pornographic" equity valuations

### 4. Greg Abel Compensation

**Source:** Benzinga/Yahoo Finance, January 15, 2026

Greg Abel will earn $25 million base salary as CEO in 2026, a 19% increase from his $21 million as Vice Chairman in 2024. This is 250x more than Buffett's symbolic $100,000 salary. While reasonable for managing a $1.06T company, the contrast could become a narrative point if underperformance continues.

## Sentiment Analysis

**Current Sentiment:** Mixed to cautious

**Bear Case Strengthening:**
- Underperformance gap widening (-4.49pp YTD vs -1.96pp in W04)
- "End of an era" narrative gaining traction
- Tech dominance continuing, value/industrials not rotating as expected
- Kraft Heinz exit highlights legacy mistakes

**Bull Case Weakening:**
- Sector rotation thesis not materializing (energy mixed, financials weak)
- Operating business excellence (BNSF safety record) not translating to stock performance
- Cash deployment pressure mounting with no clear targets

**Inflection Signals:**
- Abel's proactive portfolio cleanup (Kraft Heinz) could be positive if followed by smart redeployment
- Market at extreme valuations (S&P 500 near highs, gold at $5,000) suggests Buffett/Abel caution may be prescient
- But timing is uncertain - market could stay irrational longer than expected

## Questions Emerging This Week

1. **Will the Kraft Heinz exit be followed by other portfolio cleanups?** Abel may be pruning other underperformers (BAC has been weak, down -4.02% in W04)

2. **Where will the $7.5B from KHC exit be redeployed?** More wholly-owned industrial assets? Or will it sit in cash?

3. **Is the underperformance gap widening a concern?** -4.49pp YTD is worse than -1.96pp in W04. Pattern is deteriorating, not improving.

4. **When will Q4 13F be filed?** Due February 14, 2026. Will reveal any final Buffett-era portfolio moves.

5. **Is the market setup for a correction?** S&P 500 at 6,915 (near record highs), gold at $5,000 (fear signal), extreme valuations. Buffett/Abel's cash hoard could look prescient if correction materializes.

## Assessment for Intelligence Log

**New Ideas Captured:**
- Abel as "portfolio cleaner" - willing to exit legacy mistakes quickly (Kraft Heinz)
- Cash deployment pressure intensifying with KHC exit adding $7.5B to pile
- Underperformance narrative shifting from "temporary" to "structural concern under new leadership"

**Sentiment Shifts:**
- Cautious optimism from W01-W03 has faded
- Market focusing more on underperformance than on operating business quality
- Abel's compensation (250x Buffett's) becoming talking point

**Data Patterns:**
- Underperformance gap WIDENING: -1.96pp (W04) → -4.49pp (W05 YTD)
- Top holdings broadly weak: AAPL -2.93%, BAC -2.36%, MCO -2.76%
- Only bright spots: KO +3.46%, OXY +3.28% (consumer staples and energy)
- S&P 500 near record highs while BRK.B down -3.6% YTD - divergence extreme

**Inflection Watch:**
- Kraft Heinz exit is Abel's first major portfolio move - watch for follow-on actions
- Q4 13F (Feb 14) will be critical - did Buffett make any final moves?
- Market valuation extreme - correction could validate defensive positioning
